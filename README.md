# Sound Scape

A computer vision project to detect dancers on a dance floor, calculate their
activity levels, and send that as MIDI control change events for use in DAW.

[Watch a video of the project on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbXB7bf47EY).

Our goal was to liberate the creation of music from professionals and instead empower people to have a direct impact on the music they are listening to through their bodies. As peopleâ€™s bodies influence the music through dance and in turn the music influences the dancers, a beautiful feedback loop occurs where both are influencing each other.
